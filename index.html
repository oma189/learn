Now that you’re fully aware of the different channels, here are some VERY IMPORTANT GUIDELINES we expect you to follow:
Once you join any channel, ALWAYS READ UP THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GROUP AND PINNED MESSAGES TO LEARN MORE about the channel before dropping any form of message,  Do not flaunt laid down rules. - This helps you fully understand how the channels work and saves you + other time in re-explaining or leaving you hanging.
DO NOT SPAM multiple channels with the same information. The #events-opportunities channel is specifically meant for event updates, Jobs, or scholarship opportunities you’ll like to share (SCA will not be held responsible for verifying non-SCA links posted, so please post/click with caution). Harmful contents posted will be deleted & poster removed from the community ASAP
Any other random content deems fit for the community should be posted on the #random channel
The #ask-a-mentor channel is specifically created for you to get answers from experienced devs, designers, etc in the field on  technical questions around issues you’re facing on any technical tasks or project you’re currently working on. DO NOT DROP RANDOM QUESTIONS THERE ASKING FOR  A MENTOR OR NON-TECHNICAL RELATED CONCEPTS. (if you need a dedicated mentor to work with you for a long period of time, please apply for our mentoring program cohort application)
Introductions are to be done solely on the #introductions channel immediately you join

CODE OF CONDUCT
Our community actively runs by the code of conduct found here: https://www.shecodeafrica.org/code-of-conduct
We expect every member to fully adhere to each of them as non-compliance would result in a ban from the community
DISCLAIMER
Our community platform represents the community part of She Code Africa as an organization. IT ISN’T A CODE SCHOOL /  DESIGN COLLEGE OR A FULL-TIME BOOTCAMP where you will be put into classes and taught the A-Z of your field. 

WHAT WE HELP YOU DO IS BRING TOGETHER LIKE MINDS FOR YOU TO NETWORK AND LEARN FROM, WHILE ALSO GOING A STEP FURTHER & PUTTING UP LEARNING INITIATIVES + EVENTS FREE OF CHARGE TO HELP YOU GET BETTER IN YOUR FIELD. 

Your willingness to own your own learning would determine how much of a benefit our community gives to you else it might be tough for you to integrate into it.

YOU MADE IT HERE!
